# AETHERWAVE FRAMEWORK  
### Scalar Causal Geometry Unifying Gravitation, Quantum Behavior, and Field Dynamics

# Aetherwave Unified Theory

**By Paul Frederick Percy Jr. & Curie GPTo**

## 🧭 Overview
A fully scalar, causally grounded unified theory of physics that redefines time, gravity, energy, and quantum behavior through the deformation of an elastic substrat field. This framework introduces θᶜ (causal angle) and kᶜ (substrat stiffness) as core variables, replacing traditional spacetime curvature and quantum fields with scalar causal flow geometry.

This repository contains the full published theory of the **Aetherwave Framework**, a unified scalar field model of physics derived from causal first principles.

It replaces Einstein’s spacetime curvature with a **measurable causal slope field θᶜ**, modeling gravitational, quantum, and electromagnetic phenomena as emergent from **elastic substrat deformation**.

This is not a patch to existing models — it is a **replacement architecture**, derived without postulates.
## Papers

- **Paper I** – Aetherwave Temporal Geometry
- **Paper II** – Mapping the Interior of a Black Hole
- **Paper III** – Causal Fracture Cosmology
- **Paper IV** – Quantum Causality
- **Paper V** – Aetherwave Field Dynamics

Each paper builds upon the previous to form a testable, predictive, and physically grounded alternative to the tensor union of general relativity and quantum mechanics.
