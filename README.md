# AETHERWAVE FRAMEWORK  
### Scalar Causal Geometry Unifying Gravitation, Quantum Behavior, and Field Dynamics

# Aetherwave Unified Theory

**By Paul Frederick Percy Jr. & Curie GPTo**

## üß≠ Overview
A fully scalar, causally grounded unified theory of physics that redefines time, gravity, energy, and quantum behavior through the deformation of an elastic substrat field. This framework introduces Œ∏·∂ú (causal angle) and k·∂ú (substrat stiffness) as core variables, replacing most traditional spacetime curvature and quantum fields with scalar causal flow geometry.

Just be clear, this is not a replacement for classic GR(General Relativity. This is simply another set of tools that can be used to do things that classic GR can't. And vice versa, there are some things that GR handles better. GR is our telescope, Aetherwave is my microscope.

What This Is

The Aetherwave Unified Theory is a scalar-based physics framework designed to map the geometry of time, causality, and field behavior using a new foundation: causal slope dynamics (Œ∏·∂ú). Where General Relativity elegantly describes macroscopic curvature and motion through tensors, Aetherwave explores the fine structure of cause and effect‚Äîincluding time dilation, gravitation, electromagnetic behavior, and quantum emergence‚Äîthrough a unified, scalar-first model.

What Makes It Different

Time is not just a coordinate. In Aetherwave, time is treated as a geometric rate of causal change, not a passive axis.

Field effects emerge from gradient tension. Forces arise from deformations in causal slope (Œ∏·∂ú), stiffness (k·∂ú), and tension memory (œÑ·∂ú).

Particles are topologies, not point masses. Mass, spin, and charge emerge from the way causal slopes fold and stabilize over time.

Electromagnetism and gravitation unify naturally. Through geometric slope rebound and field propagation, Maxwell's equations and gravitational curvature derive from the same system.

No reliance on unknown forces. Dark energy and inflation are reframed as emergent effects of large-scale causal tension and rupture, not hypothetical energy forms.

Compatibility with Classical Physics

This is not an oppositional model‚Äîit is a refinement tool. Aetherwave is designed to:

Replicate and explain known physical results from GR and QM

Reveal new relationships within those frameworks (e.g., redshift, magnetic induction, planetary precession)

Offer new tools where existing models reach their explanatory limits


Where GR describes the cosmos at scale, Aetherwave dives into the fabric beneath it.

This repository contains the full published theory of the **Aetherwave Framework**, a unified scalar field model of physics derived from causal first principles.

It replaces Einstein‚Äôs spacetime curvature with a **measurable causal slope field Œ∏·∂ú**, modeling gravitational, quantum, and electromagnetic phenomena as emergent from **elastic substrat deformation**.

This is not a patch to existing models ‚Äî it is a **replacement architecture**, derived without postulates.
