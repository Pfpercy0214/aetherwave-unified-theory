# Aetherwave Unified Theory

**By Paul Frederick Percy Jr. & Curie GPTo**

A fully scalar, causally grounded unified theory of physics that redefines time, gravity, energy, and quantum behavior through the deformation of an elastic substrat field. This framework introduces θᶜ (causal angle) and kᶜ (substrat stiffness) as core variables, replacing traditional spacetime curvature and quantum fields with scalar causal flow geometry.

## Papers

- **Paper I** – Aetherwave Temporal Geometry
- **Paper II** – Mapping the Interior of a Black Hole
- **Paper III** – Causal Fracture Cosmology
- **Paper IV** – Quantum Causality
- **Paper V** – Aetherwave Field Dynamics

Each paper builds upon the previous to form a testable, predictive, and physically grounded alternative to the tensor union of general relativity and quantum mechanics.
